.SH NAME
simple_shell \- A custom UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a custom sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.
.PP
The shell can be used in both interactive and non-interactive modes.
.SH FEATURES
.SS Interactive Mode
In interactive mode, the shell displays a prompt
.I #cisboring$
and waits for the user to type a command. The command is then executed, and the prompt is displayed again.
.SS Non-interactive Mode
In non-interactive mode, the shell reads commands from a pipe or a file redirection and executes them before exiting.
.SH BUILT-INS
The following built-in commands are supported:
.TP
.B exit [status]
Exits the shell with the given status. If no status is provided, it exits with the status of the last command executed.
.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables to the standard output.
.SH ERRORS
When a command is not found, the shell prints an error message in the format:
.I executable_name: line_number: command_name: not found
.SH SIGNALS
The shell ignores the
.B Ctrl+C
(SIGINT) signal, ensuring the shell does not exit when the user attempts to terminate a foreground process.
